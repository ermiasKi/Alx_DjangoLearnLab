# 🏡 Airbnb Backend Clone

This project is a backend clone of Airbnb, built with Django and Django REST Framework. The goal of this project is to provide a solid foundation for building robust, scalable backend systems using modern technologies.  

It replicates key features of a rental platform, including **user management, property listings, bookings, payments, and reviews**. Additionally, it introduces best practices like CI/CD, containerization, and security.

## 🎯 Objectives

### 1. Set Up Django Development Environment
- Install Django and create a new Django project.
- Familiarize yourself with the project’s default structure.
- Run the development server to ensure the environment is working.

### 2. Implementing and Interacting with Django Models
- Create a Django app to manage business logic.
- Define Django models with attributes such as **Users, Properties, Bookings, Payments, and Reviews**.
- Perform and document CRUD operations using Django’s ORM via the Django shell.

### 3. Utilizing the Django Admin Interface
- Register your models with the Django admin.
- Customize the admin interface for better data management and visibility.
